# Mock Website 1: Restaurant home page / menu


Mock website design for restaurant. Built from scratch using HTML and CSS.


This is essentially a rough draft of a fully functioning web application. As of today (December 29th) I have only incorporated HTML and CSS, and I plan on implementing functionality by way of JavaScript after I have made all design refinements.
The purpose of this project is to get me to be more familiar and comfortable using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS instead of relying on a framework or library (such as Tailwind, Bootstrap, React, etc.). Obviously frameworks and libraries are important and should be utilizied, but I want to make sure that I actually understand the material that these outside resources help aid with. This is a work in progress, and I will be updating this repository regularly with new features, designs, and improvements implemented each time. The final product will be an excellent addition to my portfolio and will help me to better understand the process of front-end web application development.
