<!---------- CODE DOCUMENTATION AND NOTES ---------->

<!--

1. Focus first on the HTML and make sure everything is nested and structured properly. Have some sort of idea of what I want to design
and then worry about the CSS (after HTML aspect is complete).

2. After both HTML and CSS are finalized and ready, incorporate JavaScript

3. After JavaScript has been added, project is complete. Deploy website through Github

4. While website is up through Github, try to find/buy domain name for Miami Spice if step 5 is followed through

5. Offer website to mom and Gigi for their *potential* business 

6. Display three menu items as cards in middle of screen

7. Add pictures to menu items within their respective divs/containers

8. Incorporate media queries in order to make images responsive

9. Figure out how to use bootstrap and get more familiar with the idea that a lot of developers don't code from scratch;
insstead, they use an already established library that helps them with already well designed layouts for web dev. 

10. TRY DOING EVERYTHING WITH VANILLA HTML AND CSS (NO FRAMEWORK TO HELP) FIRST. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND HOW
BOTH LANGUAGES WORK WITHOUT THE HELP OF ANY OUTSIDE SOURCE. AFTER YOU DEVELOP A DECENT UNDERSTANDING, YOU CAN USE FRAMEWORKS.
